COMPILING

The makefile for this interface is still preliminary, I will write a decent
one when I have the time.  It needs all the compiled files from dynare++,
but doesn't know how to make them.  So first you need to run make in the
src/ directory, then run make in extern/R.

You need Rinternals.h to make this file.  If you are not using prepackaged R
on Unix/Linux, you need to modify the variable RINCLUDE in the Makefile
accordingly.

To compile dynare++, read doc/compiling-notes.txt.

INSTALLATION

Copy the dynareR.r and dynareR.so files to your working directory so that R
can find them.
