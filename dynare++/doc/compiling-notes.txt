It is suggested that you compile Dynare++ with gcc version 3.4.  If you have
other versions of gcc installed on your system, you need to select version
3.4, for example,

$ make "CC=gcc-3.4"

For linking, you need to compile the required linear algebra libraries
(blas, atlas, etc).  Alternatively, you can install precompiled versions of
these -- make sure that you select the version that matches your CPU.

For example, if you have an SSE2 capable CPU, then on Debian GNU/Linux
(etch) you need to install the following packages to get the precompiled
linear algebra libraries:

lapack3-dev
atlas3-sse2-dev

Then set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, eg

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib/sse2

before calling make.  This will include the shared libraries in the search
path for ld.
