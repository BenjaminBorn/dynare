# OBSOLETE MACRO
#
#   Deprecated because of licensing issues. The Lesser GPL imposes licensing
#   restrictions on the generated configure script unless it is augmented
#   with an Autoconf Exception clause.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_LATEX_BIBTEX_TEST(FILEDATA,BIBDATA,VARIABLETOSET,[NOCLEAN])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macros creates a bib file called contest.bib with BIBDATA,
#   executes the latex application with FILEDATA as input, then runs
#   bibtex on the resulting aux file, and finally sets VARIABLETOSET
#   to yes or no depending on the result. If NOCLEAN is set, the folder
#   used for the test is not deleted after testing.
#
#   The macro assumes that the variables PDFLATEX and BIBTEX are set.
#
#   Adapted from the macro AX_LATEX_TEST by SÃ©bastien Villemot.
