dynare (4.0~rc1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First release candidate for 4.0 series
  * Updates to the manual:
    - added empty entries for commands new in Dynare 4
    - removed obsolete commands
    - improved description of valid mathematical expressions
  * Added interface to Gary Anderson's AIM package (not yet documented)
  * Fix copyright/license headers for most source files
  * Replaced functions related to probability distributions (CDF, PDF, quantile)
    by GPL'd ones
  * Added preprocessor support for inverse gamma of type 2
  * New command "model_info" providing informations about the block structure
    of the model
  * Informations about determistic simulations (number of iterations, error...)
    are now saved in oo_
  * Added Independent Metropolis Hastings and multivariate student as an
    alternative to multivariate normal for the proposal distribution. The
    default posterior sampling algorithm is random walk metropolis with a
    gaussian proposal distribution.
  * Added trace plots
  * Added autocorrelogram for the posterior draws
  * If no variable given to "estimation" command, the user is asked to confirm
    that she wants to obtain posterior statistics for all the endogenous
    variables of the model. The user can then choose between:
    - the set of all the endogenous variables
    - the set of all observed variables
    - stop Dynare and edit the mod file (to add a list of variables after the
      estimation command)
  * Option "order" is now allowed in "estimation" command
  * Warn the user when she tries to estimate a model with non zero steady state
    (for the observed endogenous variables) using demeaned data (i.e. prefilter=1)
  * Added computation of posterior moments for endogenous variables (triggered by
    "moments_varendo" option). First order moments are still missing.
  * Allow for normcdf(x) in the .mod file (equivalent to normcdf(x,0,1))
  * Many bug fixes and enhancements

dynare (4~svn.20080711) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New functions for posterior distribution processing
  * Added diffuse_filter option
  * Removed more global variables
  * Improvements on numerical gradient in Sims optimizer
  * Improvements on Octave compatibility
  * Added a warning when Matlab < 6.5 or Octave < 3.0.0
  * Many bug fixes
  * Some updates to the manual (which is still far from up to date!)
  * Packaging issues:
    - Added copyright, README.Debian and README.source files
    - Added documentation to package (manual and userguide are registered through
      doc-base)
    - Fixes for compilation on GNU/Linux on amd64 architecture

dynare (4~svn.20080619) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New SVN snapshot.
  * Changes to packaging:
    - All files are now installed under /usr/lib/dynare.
    - Added new packages for Matlab which contains compiled MEX files.
    - No longer depend on octave-miscellaneous.
    - Compile preprocessor with g++-4.1: Matlab 7.4 and 7.5 override libstdc++-6
      with their own version, which is not compatible with newer versions of
      g++-4.2.
    - Use debhelper version 6 for compatibility with Ubuntu "Hardy Heron"

dynare (4~svn.20080613) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
